#### What is a solution?



#### Solution Package:

1. Demo video \(2-5 minutes\): showing off how cool a solution can be.
2. Webinar \(1 hour\): providing an overview of the benefits, some example customers \(if we have any\), resources they can use to learn, etc
3. Solution document: outlines the various architectural options and flow implementation approaches, key pieces of information around team, delivery, technology, etc that need to be in place to be successful.
4. Workshop \(day / 1/2 day\): walk through of the solution document as a training exercise
5. Accreditation: some form of accreditation \(unofficial\) on the solution delivery that could be given to G/SIs interested in learning as well as customers



#### Solution Benefits :

1. Give sales something more specific to sell
2. Make delivery more successful and allow us to target certain G/SIs as needed
3. Reduce burden on R&D as we won't have open ended use-cases
